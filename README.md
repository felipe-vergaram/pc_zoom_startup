# pc_zoom_startup
Small python script that uses pyautogui to connect my grandfather's PC to internet (with usb stick) and open zoom. He is old doesn't know how to use a PC, so this script will allow him to receive zoom calls without any keyboard or mouse input.
Zoom has an Auto-Accept-Call wich is enabled. All this script needs to do is to start the internet connection from de ISP internet stick (with GUI, that's why I used pyatuogui) and then start Zoom.
